# Intelligent Repository Manager for GitHub

## Overview

The Intelligent Repository Manager is a Python tool that automatically categorizes and tags GitHub repositories based on their content, code analysis, and usage history. This helps users better organize their repositories and find relevant projects more quickly.

## Features

- Fetches repositories for a given GitHub user.
- Analyzes repository content using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Categorizes repositories using KMeans clustering.
- Tags repositories with appropriate categories.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- GitHub API access token

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wasserpuncher/intelligent-repo-manager.git
   cd intelligent-repo-manager

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
      pip install requests PyGithub scikit-learn nltk matplotlib

3. Download NLTK data:
    "python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords"

 ## Usage 

 Usage
Replace your_github_access_token in the intelligent_repo_manager.py file with your GitHub API access token.

Replace your_github_username in the main function with the GitHub username you want to analyze.

Run the script:

bash
Code kopieren
python intelligent_repo_manager.py
How It Works
Fetching Repositories: The tool fetches all repositories for the given GitHub user.
Content Analysis: It preprocesses the content of each repository by tokenizing and removing stop words.
Clustering: The preprocessed text is vectorized and clustered using KMeans.
Tagging: Each repository is tagged with a category based on the cluster it belongs to.

### Explanation
- **Fetching Repositories**: The tool fetches all repositories for a given GitHub user using the GitHub API.
- **Content Analysis**: It preprocesses the content of each repository by tokenizing it and removing stop words using NLTK.
- **Clustering**: The preprocessed text is vectorized using TF-IDF and clustered into categories using KMeans. The clusters are visualized using PCA.
- **Tagging**: Each repository is tagged with a category based on the cluster it belongs to.

This README provides clear instructions for setting up and using the tool, ensuring that anyone can easily follow along.
